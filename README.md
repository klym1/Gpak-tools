*this project is still under development*

[![build](https://github.com/klym1/Gpak-tools/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/klym1/Gpak-tools/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Description

C# library for reading **GPAK** files (have *.gp* extension) which were utilized for storing graphical data in some old games (such as **Cossacks** and **American Conquest** from **GSC Game World** company). Library produces Bitmap objects which can be saved using ordinary image format (e.g. *PNG*).

Format specs were reverse engineered completely from scratch. There is still room for improvements since not all available GP files can be successfully recovered. 

## Goals

This project is rather for "prototyping" purposes then for real world usage. 

Main goal is to recover (or reverse engineer) image format specs and implement some sort of converter to common image format. And I'm happy, because this goal is almost achieved. 

Next goal is to improve code quality, improve performance and make usable for real world applications (maybe for HTML5 games).

## Dev/Run

Requires the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) on Windows (the projects target `net10.0-windows`, because `System.Drawing` and WinForms are Windows-only on modern .NET). Open `src/GPExtractor.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 or later, or use the CLI:

```
dotnet build src/GPExtractor.sln
dotnet test src/GPExtractor.sln
dotnet run --project src/WindowsFormsTestClient
```

NuGet dependencies (NUnit, FluentAssertions, System.Drawing.Common) are restored automatically on build.
